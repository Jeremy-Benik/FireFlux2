# FireFlux2
All my Data and codes for the fireflux2 experiment
This was all the data and codes I used to look at the data from the towers and anemometers for the fireflux2 experiment. 
A lot of these codes plot data from the towers to better visualize what was going on, and a lot of these codes time average the data to try and find a
proper time interval to average the data over so the wind speeds can then be put into an input_sounding file to then be run on the cluster.
