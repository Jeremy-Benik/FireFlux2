#here is what I have found so far:
'''Notes: I think the coordinate system 
Faces north and starts at the bottom left. 
My reasoning behind this is that in the ncview function, 
I see the fire propagate downwards, indicating 
it would then have to start from the bottom left since the wind vector 
plot has all positive lat an lon values. Now I need to find where the 
towers are but I should be able to do that using google. 
Bottom left anemometer:
lat:  29째22'55.74"N = 29.38215
lon:  95째 2'34.01"W = -95.04280555555556

Main tower: 
 29째23'16.71"N = 29.387975
 95째 2'29.12"W = -95.04142222222222

#and then adds those two together, then it takes everything except the first layer of the cube and adds those together, this way the units will line up better
#and be treated as in the middle of the cube per the example that I was told. This mainly has to do with the fact that the variables needed are bottom_top stag
#which changes a lot here since it is not treated in the middle of the cube, instead the face of the cube, so we need to do this math to average it out
#this equation along with a better explanation can be found at https://wiki.openwfm.org/wiki/How_to_interpret_WRF_variables

#I will need one similar line for height, and this will at the height that I want.
