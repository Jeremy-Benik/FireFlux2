# Sounding Codes
These codes plot a sounding from the fireflux2 sounding file from the main website. 
the ff2_sounding code plots a sounding of the data, Temperature vs Z, Wind speeds for the first 40 meters, and the wind speeds vs height. 
These are to get an idea of the structure of the atmosphere at the time of the fire, and to see how the temperature was changing. The wind profiles
are to see how windy the conditions were according to the sounding data. 
The Potential_temp_vs_z code plots the potential temperature vs. z. This is to see how the potential temperature changed with Z. There is a bit of 
an error in this plot as theta changes rapidly in the first couple meters then settles out.
