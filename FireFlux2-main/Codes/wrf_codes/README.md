# WRF Codes (input and output files)


wrfout_vector_plot.py creates a wind vector plot at certain levels. The winds are pointed towards the tower if looking at it that way. This code takes in a wrfout file and plots U and V at various height levels. This code will have to be put into a server with a wrfout file since the files are too big to fit into the data file in this github.
